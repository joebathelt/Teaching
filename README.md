# Demonstration Notebooks
Welcome! This repository contains IPython Notebooks with annotations on different topics (at the moment one). The notebooks should fully render in your browser.

If you want to run the code on your own computer, open a console and type the following (should work on Mac and Linux, no guarantee for Windows):

'''
mkdir 'Notebooks_from_Joe'
cd 'Notebooks_from_Joe'
git clone --recursive https://github.com/joebathelt/Teaching
jupyter notebook
'''

Let me know, if this does not work for any reason

Joe
